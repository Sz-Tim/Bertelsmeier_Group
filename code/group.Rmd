TIM EDITED THIS!

EDIT ME! It uses markdown formatting, so **this is bold**.  

EDIT ME! And *this is in italics*.  

Uhm [how you add a URL](https://www.google.com).  

EDIT ME! Making tables is sort of annoying, but you can use R code instead.  

hey hey hey! 

EDIT ME! That works for figures and statistics too.  

EDIT ME! R Notebooks can be nice for EDA or analyses because you can intersperse text, code, and output.  

EDIT ME! The package *knitr* turns the markdown into html, pdf, or other file type as specified in the YAML header.
